# Idlers Tensioners Aligned

**Trident front idlers with tensioners aligned to bearings**

Modified front idlers as the idlers/bolts were tilting a bit. In my head aligning the center point of tilt and tension makes sense, they run true now. 
This modification also prevents splitting of the two printed parts, but unfortunately looks less streamlined because the left and right are offset.

Disclaimer: Only tested this on my printer, use at your own risk.
