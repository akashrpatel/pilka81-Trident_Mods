# Z Carriages FLEX

**Trident Z carriages with a printed compliant spring mechanism**

Trident Z carriages with a printed compliant spring mechanism to allow for some leadscrew wobble. 
Top leadscrew mounts (with F688 bearings) are optional, but Z is more accurate with them in my case.
Inspired by ortho-planar spring behavior studies.

2 heatset inserts go into the bottom of each carriage. The leadscrew nut is attached using 2 M3x8 screws with the spacer in between.

Disclaimer: Only tested this on my printer, use at your own risk.
